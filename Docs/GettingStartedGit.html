        <h2>
            Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>Git is a version control system that tracks changes in code, enabling developers to manage versions, roll
            back to previous states, and collaborate efficiently. In courses like ELEC50014, Git facilitates code
            sharing among project partners (if this is part of the course) and further allows instructors to distribute
            project starter code to students.</p>

        <h3>Step 1. Create a GitHub account and install git</h3>
        <p>There are two components involved in setting up Git. One component is that you must have an account on a
            repository hosting service (that is, a website where you can put your code so your partner can access it).
            The repository hosting service we use in ELEC50014 is called GitHub. The other component is the Git command
            line tools, which allow you to interface with Git locally.</p>

        <h4>Step 1a. Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one already)</h3>
            <p>To sign up for a GitHub account, open GitHub.com in a browser and choose your username, imperial email,
                and password. Then, select the “free” plan, and then you will be taken to your homepage. Now, you need
                to verify your email account. Click on the tool icon in the top right corner to get to account settings,
                then select emails, and click the “verify” button next to your email address. Then, go to your email to
                confirm.C</p>
            <p>Check if git is installed:</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>git --version</code></pre>
            <p>If you see a version number, git is already installed.</p>
            <h4>Step 1b. Install git (if not already installed):</h4>
            <p>On Linux (Ubuntu / Debian): </p>
            <pre class="console"><code>sudo apt install git   <!-- Debian-based -->
</code></pre>
            <p>On macOS (you first need to install Homebrew if you don't have it already): </p>
            <pre class="console"><code>brew install git</code></pre>
            <h3>Step 2. Configure Git to connect to GitHub using SSH</h3>
            <p>We now need to configure Git to connect with our GitHub account, using the SSH protocol.</p>

            <h4>Step 2a. Generate an SSH Key</h4>
            <p>We can use either the SSH or HTTPS protocols to connect Git from our local machine to the remote GitHub
                server. Both protocols provide a secure connection. We will use SSH, as this will allow continued use
                without repeated authentication.</p>

            <p>Generate the SSH key as follows. On the bash terminal, run:</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"</code></pre>
            <p>When prompted:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Press <strong>Enter</strong> to save the key in the default location
                    (<code>~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code>).</li>
                <li>Leave the paraphrase blank.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>After this, two files are created:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>id_ed25519</code>: Your private key (keep this secure).</li>
                <li><code>id_ed25519.pub</code>: Your public key (this will be added to GitHub).</li>
            </ul>


            <h4>Step 2b. Add the Public Key to GitHub</h4>

            <p>Follow these steps to add your SSH public key to GitHub:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Copy your public key to the clipboard by running the following command in your terminal:
                    <pre class="console"><code>cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>Open GitHub in your browser and log in to your account.</li>
                <li>Navigate to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Settings (in the menu after you click on your profile picture on the top right of page)</li>
                        <li>Click on SSH and GPG keys.</li>
                        <li>Click on New SSH key.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Add your key:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Title: Enter a descriptive title (e.g., "My Laptop - WSL").</li>
                        <li>Key: Paste your public key.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Click Add SSH key.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>To test the SSH connection, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open the terminal and run the following command:
                    <pre class="console"><code>ssh -T git@github.com</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>If the connection is successful, you will see a message similar to the following:
                    <pre
                        class="console"><code>Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.</code></pre>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Step 2c. Configure Git to use SSH</h4>
            <p>To configure Git to use SSH, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Update your repository's remote URL to use SSH by running the following command in the terminal:
                    <pre
                        class="console"><code>git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git</code></pre>
                    <p>Replace <code>username</code> with your GitHub username and <code>repository</code> with the name
                        of your repository.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Verify the updated remote URL by running:
                    <pre class="console"><code>git remote -v</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>Ensure the output shows the SSH URL format, similar to this:
                    <pre class="console"><code>origin  git@github.com:username/repository.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:username/repository.git (push)</code></pre>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Step 3. Create a repository</h3>
            <p>Create a new directory for the repository:</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>mkdir hello-git
cd hello-git
</code></pre>

            <p>Initialize the git repository:</p>
            <p>The following will create a repository in your current directory (hello-git in this case).</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>git init</code></pre>
            <p><code>git init</code> initializes a local repository, allowing git to
                track changes made in the folder.</p>

            <h3>Step 4 (Optional). Clone an existing repository</h3>
            <p>For now, you may not need this step as you are creating your first repository. However, at some point
                you
                may need to clone a repository provided to you, or that you have created remotely on GitHub, onto
                your
                local machine.</p>
            <p>Clone an existing repository:</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>git clone git@github.com:yourusername/repository-name.git
            </code></pre>

            <p>Note: GitHub provides a URL for every repository, ending with .git. On GitHub you can find this URL
                by
                going to your repository page and clicking on the <code>Code</code> drop down menu.</p>

            <p>Navigate into the cloned repository:</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>cd repository-name</code></pre>
            <p>
                Overall, <<code>git clone</code> creates a <strong>copy of a remote repository</strong> on your
                    local machine, making it ready for development.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 5. Open a local repository in VSCode</h3>
            <p>Open the repository folder in VSCode:</p>
            <p>Make sure you have navigated into the repository folder. Then execute:</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>code .</code></pre>
            <p>This can also be done from within VSCode by selecting File > Open Folder... (choosing your repository
                folder)</p>
            <p>From here on, you can open the shell from within VSCode by selecting Terminal > New Terminal...</p>
            <p>This sets us up to use git from within VSCode, making code implementation and integration a seamless
                process.</p>
            <p>Verify git integration:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>VSCode automatically detects the repository if it’s initialized.</li>
                <li>Open the Source Control (Explorer) tab on the left sidebar.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 6. Example: Managing a C++ File</h3>
            <p>Create a file: <code>helloworld.cpp</code> in VSCode (which is opened in your repository folder)</p>

            <div class="code-container" data-filename="../cpp/helloworld.cpp">
                <pre><code class="language-cpp" id="cpp-code">
                </code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>Stage the file:</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>git add helloworld.cpp</code></pre>
            <p><code>git add</code> moves changes to the staging area, preparing them
                for a commit.</p>

            <p>Commit the file:</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>git commit -m "Added helloworld.cpp"</code></pre>
            <p><code>git commit</code> saves changes permanently to your local
                repository, along with a message describing what was done.</p>

            <p>Modify the file: change <code>Hello, World!</code> to <code>Hello, Git!</code></p>

            <p>Stage and commit again:</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>git add helloworld.cpp
git commit -m "Updated message in helloworld.cpp"
</code></pre>

            <p>Push changes to remote repository:</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>git push origin main</code></pre>
            <p><code>git push</code> uploads committed changes from the local
                repository to a remote repository.</p>

            <h3>Step 7. Pull changes</h3>
            <p>Pull latest changes from remote repository:</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>git pull origin main</code></pre>
            <p><code>git pull</code> downloads and integrates updates from the remote
                repository into your local project.</p>

            <h2>Basic Git Commands</h2>
            <p>This is a summary of the basic Git commands you have seen above.</p>
            <p>A quick reference to some of the most common git commands is <a href="GitRef.html"
                    target="_blank">available here</a>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>git status</strong> - Tells you the status of your local repository: what files have
                    been
                    added, deleted, and changed since your last commit. It also shows which changes are in staging
                    and
                    which ones aren’t. When a change is in staging, it will be included in the next commit. If you
                    have
                    text coloring enabled, staged changes appear <span style="color: green;">green</span> and
                    unstaged
                    changes appear <span style="color: red;">red</span> (the same colors appear in VSCode).
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>git add &lt;file/folder&gt;</strong> - Stages the specified file or folder. You can use
                    regular expressions to include multiple files or run <code>git add</code> multiple times for
                    different files. If you stage a file but make changes afterward, it automatically gets unstaged,
                    so
                    you must run <code>git add</code> again.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>git commit</strong> - Commits the changes that were staged. Think of this as logging a
                    new
                    version of your code with the set of staged changes. Git will open its text editor so that you
                    can
                    add a message describing the changes. Writing clear and informative commit messages can help
                    your
                    collaborators (and your future self) understand what was changed in previous commits. Note that
                    all
                    commits only exist on your local copy until you push them to the remote repository.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>git push</strong> - Pushes all local commits since your last push to the remote
                    repository.
                    This allows collaborators to access your changes. If someone else has made changes to the remote
                    repository while you were working, Git may require you to perform a <code>git pull</code> before
                    you
                    can push your changes.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>git pull</strong> - Pulls all commits from the remote repository that your local version
                    doesn’t have. This retrieves any changes that others working on your project have pushed since
                    the
                    last time you pulled. You should commit all your changes before doing this to avoid losing them.
                </li>
            </ul>
