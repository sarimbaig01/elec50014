        <section class="statement">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows users to run a Linux environment directly on Windows, providing
                seamless integration between the two systems. It is designed for developers and power users who need
                Linux tools and commands while working in a Windows environment.</p>
            <p>WSL has two versions: WSL1 and WSL2. WSL2 is the newer, faster version that uses a lightweight virtual
                machine (VM) architecture running on a hypervisor. A <strong>hypervisor</strong> is a software layer
                that allows
                multiple operating systems to share the same physical hardware. It provides virtualization, which means
                the Linux kernel runs in a VM but integrates so seamlessly that users experience it as part of Windows.
            </p>
            <p>Unlike traditional virtual machines, WSL2 is optimized for performance and usability, so it feels like
                native Linux without the need for dual-boot setups. The main advantage is that you can switch between
                Windows and Linux tools instantly, with shared file access.</p>
            <p>WSL2 is available on the following Windows versions:
            <ul>
                <li>Windows 10 Version 1903 (Build 18362) or later (Pro, Enterprise, or Education editions).</li>
                <li>Windows 11 (all editions).</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Why Do We Need WSL for this Course?</h3>
            <p>This course explores operating systems concepts, such as process management, threading, memory
                management, and scheduling algorithms, which are deeply tied to Unix-based systems. Unix environments
                like Linux provide the tools and architecture necessary to interact directly with these underlying
                concepts.</p>
            <p>Linux is a good and widely used choice because it is open-source, powerful, and versatile. Its system
                design makes it ideal for learning core operating systems concepts through direct, hands-on experience.
                Additionally, Linux is heavily used in the software development industry, cloud environments, and server
                management, making it an essential skill for most engineers.</p>

            <h2>Installing WSL and Ubuntu</h2>
            <p>To use WSL, you first need to install and set up the environment on your Windows system. Below are the
                steps to ensure everything is ready.</p>

            <h3>Check System Requirements</h3>
            <p>Before installing WSL, verify that your system meets the requirements. This step ensures compatibility
                and avoids issues during installation.</p>

            <p> Note: Virtualization must also be enabled in your BIOS (this is enabled by default in most modern PCs;
                therefore, it is not explained below. If, however, you run into this issue, please let me know).</p>

            <h3>Enable WSL</h3>
            <p>Enabling WSL sets up the Linux subsystem on your Windows machine. This command automates the installation
                process.</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>wsl --install</code></pre>
            <p>This command installs WSL, sets WSL 2 as the default version, and installs the default Linux distribution
                (e.g., Ubuntu).</p>

            <h3>Complete Linux Distribution Setup</h3>
            <p>Once WSL is installed, you need to configure the Linux distribution. This includes setting up your
                username and password for the Ubuntu environment. When prompted for a username and password, use a
                simple username (such as your first name) and a short and memorable password.</p>

            <p>Launch Ubuntu, follow the on-screen prompts, and complete the initial configuration.</p>

            <pre class="console"><code>ubuntu</code></pre>

            <p><strong>You are now in a Bash terminal using the Bash shell.</strong></p>


            <h3>Access Files</h3>
            <p>After installation, you can access your files from both Windows and Linux environments. The file paths
                differ depending on the operating system.</p>

            <p>Windows files are accessible in WSL under <code>/mnt/drive_letter</code>, such as <code>/mnt/c</code>.
                Conversely, Linux files are accessible from Windows using <code>\\wsl$\</code> in the file explorer's
                address bar.</p>

            <p>
            <fieldset>
                <legend>File paths in Linux</legend>
                <p>In Linux, file paths describe the location of files and directories within the file system. Paths can
                    be <strong>absolute</strong>, starting from the root directory (<code>/</code>), or
                    <strong>relative</strong>, starting from the current working directory. For example, the absolute
                    path <code>/home/user/Documents/file.txt</code> specifies the exact location of
                    <code>file.txt</code>, whereas the relative path <code>Documents/file.txt</code> refers to the same
                    file when your current directory is <code>/home/user</code>.
                </p>
                <p>Linux uses a forward slash (<code>/</code>) to separate directories in a path. Special symbols like
                    <code>.</code> (current directory) and <code>..</code> (parent directory) help navigate the file
                    system. For instance, if you are in <code>/home/user</code> and want to access <code>file.txt</code>
                    in <code>Documents</code>, the relative path would be <code>./Documents/file.txt</code>, and moving
                    up one level to <code>/home</code> would require <code>cd ..</code>. Understanding these basics
                    makes working with the Linux file system more efficient.
                </p>

            <h2>Installing g++ and lldb on Ubuntu</h2>

            <p>To compile and debug C++ code, as you will be doing in this course, you need to install tools like g++
                and lldb in your Ubuntu environment. (You need to install g++ in Ubuntu even if you already have it in
                the Windows environment since we will be using it from within Ubuntu.)
                These tools are standard for Linux-based development. Note: I will be introducing lldb in more detail on
                a later page.</p>

            <pre class="console"><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++ lldb</code></pre>

            <p><code>apt</code> is the package manager for Linux, used to install, update, and manage software.
                <code>sudo</code> grants administrative privileges needed for system-level tasks. The command
                <code>sudo apt update</code> refreshes the list of available software, and
                <code>sudo apt install g++ lldb</code> installs the GNU C++ compiler and the LLVM Debugger for compiling
                and debugging C++ programs.
            </p>

            <h2>Installing the WSL Extension on VSCode</h2>
            <p>To integrate VSCode with WSL, you need to install the 'WSL' extension, from the VSCode extensions pane.
                This extension enables a seamless workflow between your Windows editor and the Linux environment.</p>

            <h3>Install the Extension</h3>

            <p>Open Visual Studio Code from Windows, navigate to the Extensions Marketplace, search for 'WSL' extension
                by
                Microsoft, and click Install.</p>

            <h3>Open WSL in VS Code</h3>
            <p>Once the extension is installed, you can open a new WSL session directly in VS Code. This connects your
                editor to the Linux environment.</p>
            <p>Press <code>Ctrl + Shift + P</code> to open the Command Palette. Type <code>WSL: New Window</code> and
                select it to open a WSL session in VS Code.</p>

            <h3>Open a Linux Folder</h3>
            <p>To work on files within the Linux environment, open a folder from WSL in VS Code. This allows you to edit
                and debug code seamlessly.</p>
            <p>Use the menu option <code>File > Open Folder</code> in VS Code to navigate to your WSL file system. A
                common path to open is <code>/home/username</code>.</p>

            <h2>Using VS Code with WSL</h2>
            <p>Once connected to WSL, you can use VS Code to edit, debug, and run Linux-based projects seamlessly.
                Extensions like C++ tools can be installed inside WSL for enhanced integration.</p>

            <h3>Compiling a Simple C++ Program</h3>
            <p>Follow these steps to create and compile a simple C++ program (e.g., <code>helloworld.cpp</code>) from
                WSL within VS Code:</p>
            <p>1. Open a new terminal within VSCode. In the terminal, create a folder named <code>hello_world</code> to
                organize your files:</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>mkdir hello_world</code></pre>
            <p>Navigate into the folder using:</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>cd hello_world</code></pre>

            <p>2. Open VS Code connected to WSL, and inside the <code>hello_world</code> folder, create a file named
                <code>helloworld.cpp</code>. Save the file by pressing <code>Ctrl + S</code>. If you encounter issues
                saving the file, see the section below on file permissions.
            </p>

            <p>3. Compile the program using the following
                command:</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld</code></pre>
            <p>This creates an executable file named <code>helloworld</code>.</p>

            <p>4. Run the program with the command:</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>./helloworld</code></pre>
            <p>You should see the expected output of your program.</p>

            <h3>Handling File Permissions</h3>
            <p>If you encounter issues saving or compiling the file due to insufficient permissions, you may need to
                update the file's ownership. Run the following command in the terminal to assign ownership of the file
                to your user:</p>
            <pre class="console"><code>sudo chown your_username:your_username helloworld.cpp</code></pre>
            <p><code>chown</code> stands for <strong>change ownership</strong>; it modifies the ownership of a file or
                directory, assigning it to a specified user and/or group.</p>
            <p>Replace <code>your_username</code> with your WSL (Ubuntu) username. After this, you should be able to
                save and
                compile the file without any issues.</p>
