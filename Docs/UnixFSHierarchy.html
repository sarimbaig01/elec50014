        <section class="statement">
            <h2>File System Hierarchy in a Unix-like system</h2>
            <p>Most modern operating systems arrange files and directories in a hierarchical fashion. In Unix-based
                systems, such as Linux and macOS, this hierarchy resembles a tree structure, beginning with a root
                directory. To work effectively with these systems, especially when interacting through a shell, it is
                essential to understand the file system hierarchy and related terminology. This article provides a
                beginner-friendly introduction to the topic.</p>
            <h3>1. Inspecting the hierarchy with <span style="font-family: monospace;">tree</span></h3>
            <p>It is useful to begin by inspecting the file system hierarchy on your system. This article assumes that
                you are currently using either Linux (or WSL on Windows) or macOS. A good way to inspect the file system
                hierarchy is by using the <span style="font-family: monospace;">tree</span> command. The <span
                    style="font-family: monospace;">tree</span> command is an external utility and might not be
                installed on your system by default.</p>

            <p>To check if <span style="font-family: monospace;">tree</span> is available, open a terminal and run the
                following command:</p>

            <pre class="language-shell-session"><code>$ tree --version</code></pre>

            <p>If the command returns the version of <span style="font-family: monospace;">tree</span>, it is already
                installed on your system. If you see an error like <code>command not found</code>, you will need to
                install it.</p>

            <h4>Installing <span style="font-family: monospace;">tree</span></h4>

            <p>To install <span style="font-family: monospace;">tree</span> on Linux or macOS, use the following
                commands respectively.</p>

            <div class="double-shell">
                <p>On Linux (Ubuntu / Debian):</p>
                <pre class="language-shell-session"><code>$ sudo apt install tree</code></pre>
                <p>On macOS:</p>
                <pre class="language-shell-session"><code>$ brew install tree</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>If Homebrew is not installed on your macOS system, you can install it by running the following in your
                terminal:</p>
            <pre
                class="language-shell-session"><code>$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)</code></pre>

            <h4>Using <span style="font-family: monospace;">tree</span></h4>

            <p>Now that <span style="font-family: monospace;">tree</span> has been installed we can use it inspect the
                file system hierarchy.</p>

            <p>The root directory in Unix-based systems is represented by /
            <p>

            <p>The following example uses the <span style="font-family: monospace;">tree</span> command to show the
                contents of the root directory, i.e., the root and its immediate children only.</p>

            <pre class="language-shell-session"><code>$ tree -L 1 /</code></pre>
            <p>The -L option limits the depth of the tree, and 1 specifies one level below the root.</p>

            <p>A typical output will look like this:</p>

            <pre class="language-shell-session"><code>/
├── bin
├── boot
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
├── lib
├── lib64
├── media
├── mnt
├── opt
├── proc
├── root
├── run
├── sbin
├── srv
├── sys
├── tmp
├── usr
└── var

19 directories, 0 files</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Note for clarification</strong>: The /root directory that you see above is a child of the actual
                root (/) and typically acts as the home directory for the root user (superuser), storing the root user’s
                personal files and configurations. On macOS this is typically at /var/root.</p>

            <fieldset>
                <legend>Some important directories in root</legend>

                <p><strong>/bin</strong>: Contains essential binary executables (programs) needed for the system to
                    function, even in single-user mode. Examples include common commands like ls, cp, mkdir, and the
                    shell program bash.</p>
                <p><strong>/etc</strong>: Stores configuration files for the system and installed software. For example,
                    network settings and user account configurations can be found here.</p>
                <p><strong>/home</strong>: Contains the personal directories for regular users. Each user has a
                    subdirectory within /home (e.g., /home/username) for storing personal files and settings. (macOS
                    stores user home directories in /Users instead of /home)</p>
                <p><strong>/var</strong>: Holds variable data files, including logs, temporary files, and spool
                    directories (e.g., for print queues). This directory changes frequently as the system runs.</p>
                <p><strong>/usr</strong>: Stands for Unix System Resources and contains most user-space applications and
                    libraries. For example, /usr/bin holds non-essential programs and utilities like vim and python.</p>
            </fieldset>

            <p>The core directory structure is generally consistent across Linux distributions and macOS, adhering to
                Unix-based conventions like /bin, /etc, and /usr. However, macOS includes unique directories like
                /System and /Library, and the contents or usage of some directories can vary between systems. If you
                ever need to explore their functions, consult the official documentation for your operating system or
                search online for resources specific to your distribution or macOS version.</p>

            <p>You may use the <span style="font-family: monospace;">tree</span> command to view the hierarchy to any
                level of depth, or beginning from a subdirectory of our choice. For example, the following command shows
                the tree upto depth 2. </p>
            <pre class="language-shell-session"><code>$ tree -L 2 /</code></pre>

20 directories, 10 files
                </code></pre>
            <p>Some level 2 contents may not be visible because certain directories, like /mnt or /media, are empty
                unless populated (e.g., by mounting devices). Directories such as /proc and /sys contain virtual
                filesystems and may not display traditional files. Additionally, permissions can restrict access to
                directories like /root, requiring administrative privileges (sudo) to view their contents. If you wish
                to see these files, then run:</p>

            <pre class="language-shell-session"><code>$ sudo tree -L 2 /</code></pre>

            <h4><span style="font-family: monospace;">sudo</span> (superuser do)</h4>
            <p> <span style="font-family: monospace;">sudo</span> allows a user to execute commands with
                administrative privileges, such as installing software (<span style="font-family: monospace;">sudo apt
                    install tree</span>), editing system files (<span style="font-family: monospace;">sudo nano
                    /etc/hosts</span>), or viewing restricted directories (<span style="font-family: monospace;">sudo ls
                    /root</span>).</p>

            <h4>The home directory (~)</h4>
            <p>As mentioned above, your home directory is the base location for your user-specific data. In Linux, it is
                typically located at /home/your_username, while in macOS, it is located at /Users/your_username. The
                home directory is represented by the tilde symbol (~) in shell environments. As a beginner, it is
                important to understand the difference between the root directory (/), which is the top-level directory
                of the entire file system, and the home directory (~), which is specific to your user. Execute the
                following commands to view the contents of your home directory.</p>
            <pre class="language-shell-session"><code>$ tree -L 1 ~</code></pre>

            <br>
            <fieldset>
                <legend>Some terminology</legend>

                <p><strong>File System</strong>: The organizational structure and method used by the operating system to
                    manage files and directories on a storage device. A file system defines how data is stored,
                    retrieved, and organized into files and directories.</p>

                <p><strong>Root (/)</strong>: The top-level directory in the file system hierarchy that serves
                    as the base or starting point for all files and directories. For example, in Unix-like systems,
                    directories like /bin and /usr stem from /, while in Windows, the root of each drive is represented
                    as C:\ or D:\.</p>

                <p><strong>Home (~)</strong>: A user-specific directory for personal files, settings, and data. In
                    Linux and macOS, it is typically located under /home/username or /Users/username and is represented
                    by the tilde symbol (~) in shell environments. In Windows, it is found at C:\Users\username. This
                    directory is the default working location for users upon login.</p>

                <p><strong>Partition</strong>: A logically defined section of a disk that separates storage into
                    distinct regions, each potentially holding its own file system. For example, in Linux, partitions
                    are represented as /dev/sda1 or /dev/nvme0n1p1. In macOS, partitions are represented as
                    /dev/disk0s1, while in Windows, partitions appear as Partition 1 on Disk 0 (viewable in Disk
                    Management).</p>

                <p><strong>Volume</strong>: A logical storage unit within a partition that contains a file system. In
                    macOS, volumes such as Macintosh HD and Macintosh HD - Data share the same APFS container. In Linux,
                    mounted volumes are accessible under directories like /mnt or /media. In Windows, volumes are
                    typically represented by drive letters such as C:\ or D:\.</p>

                <p><strong>Mounting</strong>: The process of attaching a file system or storage device to a directory in
                    the file system hierarchy, making its contents accessible to the operating system. For example,
                    mounting a USB drive in Linux attaches it to /mnt/usb, while in macOS, it might be attached under
                    /Volumes.</p>

                <p><strong>Mount Point</strong>: A directory where a file system or storage device is attached,
                    integrating its contents into the unified file system hierarchy. For example, /mnt/usb might be used
                    to access a USB drive in Linux, while in macOS, volumes are mounted under /Volumes.</p>

            </fieldset>

            <h3>2. Navigating the hierarchy</h3>
            <p> The first distinction to make when navigating the file system is one between <strong> absolute
                </strong> and
                <strong>relative</strong> paths. Absolute paths specify the full location of a file or directory
                starting from the root
                (/), while relative paths are defined in relation to your current directory. Recognizing this
                difference is fundamental to effectively working within a file system.
            </p>

            <h4>View your working directory with <span style="font-family: monospace;">pwd</span></h4>

            <p>Your current directory, also called your working directory, can be viewed by using the <span
                    style="font-family: monospace;">pwd</span> (print working directory) command.</p>

            <pre class="language-shell-session"><code>$ pwd</code></pre>

            <p>The output of <span style="font-family: monospace;">pwd</span> is the absolute path to your working
                directory.</p>

            <p>Notice that an absolute path starts with /, indicating the root directory as its starting point.</p>

            <p>Relative paths, on the other hand, begin with the name of a directory (or a special symbol like . for the
                working directory or .. for the parent directory) and proceed relative to the working directory.
            </p>

            <p>For example, if your working directory is /home/user, the absolute path to a file named notes.txt
                in the documents directory (which lies inside user) would be /home/user/documents/notes.txt, while the
                relative path would be documents/notes.txt (note: no leading /).</p>
