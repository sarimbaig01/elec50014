                <legend>Some terminology</legend>

                <p><strong>File System</strong>: The organizational structure and method used by the operating system to
                    manage files and directories on a storage device. A file system defines how data is stored,
                    retrieved, and organized into files and directories.</p>

                <p><strong>Root (/)</strong>: The top-level directory in the file system hierarchy that serves
                    as the base or starting point for all files and directories. For example, in Unix-like systems,
                    directories like /bin and /usr stem from /, while in Windows, the root of each drive is represented
                    as C:\ or D:\.</p>

                <p><strong>Home (~)</strong>: A user-specific directory for personal files, settings, and data. In
                    Linux and macOS, it is typically located under /home/username or /Users/username and is represented
                    by the tilde symbol (~) in shell environments. In Windows, it is found at C:\Users\username. This
                    directory is the default working location for users upon login.</p>

                <p><strong>Partition</strong>: A logically defined section of a disk that separates storage into
                    distinct regions, each potentially holding its own file system. For example, in Linux, partitions
                    are represented as /dev/sda1 or /dev/nvme0n1p1. In macOS, partitions are represented as
                    /dev/disk0s1, while in Windows, partitions appear as Partition 1 on Disk 0 (viewable in Disk
                    Management).</p>

                <p><strong>Volume</strong>: A logical storage unit within a partition that contains a file system. In
                    macOS, volumes such as Macintosh HD and Macintosh HD - Data share the same APFS container. In Linux,
                    mounted volumes are accessible under directories like /mnt or /media. In Windows, volumes are
                    typically represented by drive letters such as C:\ or D:\.</p>

                <p><strong>Mounting</strong>: The process of attaching a file system or storage device to a directory in
                    the file system hierarchy, making its contents accessible to the operating system. For example,
                    mounting a USB drive in Linux attaches it to /mnt/usb, while in macOS, it might be attached under
                    /Volumes.</p>

                <p><strong>Mount Point</strong>: A directory where a file system or storage device is attached,
                    integrating its contents into the unified file system hierarchy. For example, /mnt/usb might be used
                    to access a USB drive in Linux, while in macOS, volumes are mounted under /Volumes.</p>

                The height of a rectangle is the height of its shortest bar, which may be an internal or side bar.
