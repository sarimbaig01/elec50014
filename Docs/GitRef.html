                Git is a distributed version control system designed to manage and track changes in source code. 
                It allows developers to collaborate efficiently while maintaining a complete history of changes.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Git helps developers manage project versions, track changes, and maintain a history of all modifications. Even when working individually, it allows developers to manage different versions of their code, experiment with new features safely, and revert to previous states if needed. Its support for branching, merging, and distributed workflows simplifies development tasks, while maintaining a clear history of changes for future debugging and enhancements.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Git is widely used across industry, academia, and open-source projects. Companies rely on it for software development, and open-source contributors worldwide use it to collaborate on projects of all sizes.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Git commands are categorized based on functionality, including repository setup, file tracking, branch management, remote 
                collaboration, history inspection, and undoing changes.
