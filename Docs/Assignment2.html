    <section class="statement">

        <!--Intro Div-->
        <div id="intro">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>The purpose of this assignment is to provide you with an opportunity to do hands-on work in three
                important areas of software, namely: concurrency, synchronization, and communication over the internet.
            </p>

            <p>We will begin with the third part first, i.e., communication. The topic of communication will be covered
                in detail in lectures 15 and 16. For this assignment, however, we will implement only the basic
                communication we need and abstract away the underlying details.</p>

            <p>Once the basic communication setup is in place, you will need to extend it to complete the implementation
                of a
                multithreaded chat server and clients. The requirements will be specified in the following sections.
            </p>

            <p>Overall, this assignment provides less starter code than Assignment 1. You have
                relatively more freedom to decide what functions to implement and how to structure your overall
                solution.</p>

            <p>Let's begin!</p>
        </div>

        <div id="p1">
            <h3><small>1. </small>Client-Server Communication</h3>
            <p>Both the chat server and clients are software applications on the internet. There is one server and
                multiple clients. Communication between them is two-way and can be initiated by either the client or the
                server. In most cases, however, a client starts the communication by sending a request to the server,
                and the server responds to that request.</p>

            <p>The following picture shows the high-level architecture of the chat application. It is a distributed
                application. The client and server are typically (though not always) on different machines connected
                through the internet. During development, however, it is often convenient to run the client and
                server locally on the same machine.</p>

            <figure style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="../img/chat_arch.png" alt="Chat Application Architecture"
                    style="max-width: 50%; height: auto;">
                <figcaption>Figure 1: High-level architecture of the chat application</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>IP and port number</h4>
            <p>Each machine on the internet — also known as a host — has a unique address called its IP. (There are
                private and public IPs, along with other complications that we will not delve into at this point.)</p>

            <p>Any process that wishes to communicate over the internet needs to open a socket. Thanks to Unix's
                "everything is a file" philosophy, opening a socket is very similar to opening a file on disk — using a
                file descriptor. Furthermore, as all threads within the process share the same file descriptor table,
                they all have access to the socket.</p>


            <p>A socket (of the type we are using in this assignment) is identified by two pieces of information: an
                IP address and a unique 16-bit number called the port number.</p>

            <p>Together, the IP address and port number used by the socket form the identity of that communication
                endpoint on the internet. If anyone wishes to send data to it, they send it to this IP and port number
                combination.</p>

            <p>Naturally, each of our clients and the server open a socket to communicate. The IP address and port
                number of the server’s socket are known to the clients who use this information to send requests to the
                server.
            </p>

            <p>The server, in turn,uses the IP address and port number of an incoming client to communicate back.</p>

            <h4>Client-Server code</h4>

            <p>With these concepts in place, we are now ready to look at some code for client–server communication.</p>

            <p><strong>The code has been explained through comments. Please read these comments carefully to understand
                    both the code and the related concepts.</strong></p>

            <p>You have been provided with wrapper functions to open a UDP socket, write to it, read from it, and so on.
                These functions are implemented in a separate file called <code><strong><a href="/c/udp.h"
                    download="/c/udp.h">udp.h</a></strong></code>. Please download the file and read the comments in it
                also to
                understand the code.
            </p>


            <!--Communication code-->
            <p><code><strong>chat_server.c: </strong></code></p>
            <div class="code-container" data-filename="../c/chat_server.c">
                <pre><code class="language-c"></code></pre>
            </div>

            <p><code><strong>chat_client.c: </strong></code></p>
            <div class="code-container" data-filename="../c/chat_client.c">
                <pre><code class="language-c"></code></pre>
            </div>

            <h4>Build and run</h4>
            <p>Place the files <code><strong>chat_server.c</strong></code>, <code><strong>chat_client.c</strong></code>,
                and <code><strong>udp.h</strong></code> in your
                working directory, then compile them as follows:</p>

            <div class="code-container" data-filename="inline">
                <pre class="language-bash"><code>$ gcc chat_client.c -o chat_client</code></pre>
                <pre class="language-bash"><code>$ gcc chat_server.c -o chat_server</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>Start by running the server as a background process:</p>

            <div class="code-container" data-filename="inline">
                <pre class="language-bash"><code>$ ./chat_server &</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>Note the process ID (PID) of the server so that you can terminate it later if needed.</p>

            <p>Alternatively, you could run the server in a separate terminal instance.</p>

            <p>Now run the client:</p>

            <div class="code-container" data-filename="inline">
                <pre class="language-bash"><code>$ ./chat_client</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>Examine the output and observe how the client and server interact.</p>

            <p>To terminate the server when it is running as a background process (for example, if its process ID is
                63553):</p>

            <div class="code-container" data-filename="inline">
                <pre class="language-bash"><code>$ kill 63553</code></pre>
            </div>

            <h4>Try a few variations</h4>
            <p>Before moving on to the main assignment, it is useful to experiment with a few variations in
                the communication code to gain a deeper understanding of how it works. These are optional, but useful.
            </p>

            <p>For example, try the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Run two client processes with different port numbers, and have the server print each incoming
                    client’s port
                    number.
                </li>
                <li>Modify the server so that it includes the client’s IP address in its response (in
                    <code><strong>server_response</strong></code>), and observe the
                    result on the client side.
                </li>
                <li>Send a string to the server (in <code><strong>client_request</strong></code>), have the server
                    detect whether it is in lower, upper, or mixed case, and return
                    the result (in <code><strong>server_response</strong></code>) for the client to print.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="p2">
            <h3><small>2. </small>Chat Application Requirements</h3>
            <p>In this section I outline the requirements for a multi-threaded, multi-client chat application. The
                requirements are presented first for the client side and then for the server side.</p>
            <p>As mentioned in the introduction, no starter code is provided from here on. However, the requirements are
                modular and
                detailed enough that you can create your own design based on them.</p>
            <p>At the core of the application is the client–server communication described above.</p>
            <p>For the concurrency and synchronization aspects of the code, please refer to the relevant
                examples in lectures 5–8.</p>

            <h4 id="p2.1">Client-side requirements</h4>
            <p>Each client:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Binds to an available UDP port (any free port). The port must be unique for each client running on
                    the same machine.</li>
                <li>Spawns (at least) two threads:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sender thread:</strong> Reads user input (e.g., <code>say$ Hello, I'm here!</code>
                            or
                            <code>sayto$ Bob How are you?</code>) and sends the full request string to the server. The
                            part of the message before the first <code><strong>$</strong></code> is interpreted as the
                            <strong>request type</strong> and the part after it is the <strong>request content</strong>.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Listener thread:</strong> Waits for incoming responses from the server and takes the
                            appropriate action when a response is received (e.g., displaying a chat message on screen).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Supports the following request types,</strong> (entered by the user):

                    <p><strong>Design note:</strong> One clean way to implement this would be to write one function
                        per request type, and spawn a thread for the appropriate function for an incoming client
                        depending upon their request type.</p>

                <li>The server’s linked list of clients is accessed by multiple threads and must implement mutual
                    exclusion around critical sections.</li>

                <li>A custom <strong>reader–writer lock</strong> should be implemented (Note: using the inbuilt rw lock
                    from pthreads is not
                    allowed, instead you must use mutexes and condition variables (or semaphores) as described in
                    lectures):
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example, <strong>reader threads</strong> include those that:

                                <li>Broadcast messages to all connected clients</li>
                                <li>Look up specific client for <code>sayto</code></li>
                                <li>Read muted clients of a specific client</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Similarly, <strong>writer threads</strong> include those that:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Add or remove clients as they connect or disconnect respectively</li>
                                <li>Rename or kick clients</li>
                                <li>Add or remove muted users for specific clients</li>

                <figcaption>Figure 2: The Client-side interface</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Your interface does not need to be exactly the same, but it should separate the terminal window into
                two areas: one for user input and the other for displaying the chat. The chat may appear even while a
                user
                is typing their message.</p>

            <p>This part of the assignment is information-heavy, i.e., you should look up appropriate references
                (including AI tools) to learn how functions like <code>printf</code> can be used to print at specific
                areas of the screen.
                You may also explore suitable C libraries that can help create such an interface.</p>

        <div id="p3">
            <h3><small>3. Proposed Extension 1: </small>History at Connection</h3>

            <p>When a new client connects to the chat, they should be shown the last 15 broadcast messages exchanged in
                the chat prior to their arrival. This feature helps new users to catch up with recent conversation upon
                joining the chat.</p>

            <p>The messages are drawn from a shared <strong>circular buffer</strong> on the server, maintaining the
                15 most recent broadcasted messages. Naturally, the buffer must implement mutual exclusion since
                multiple threads may read from or write to it concurrently.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="p4">
            <h3><small>4. Proposed Extension 2: </small>Remove Inactive Clients</h3>
            <p>To ensure active participation and allow removal of inactive clients, the server monitors client activity
                using the following approach:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The server maintains a suitable data structure of <strong>(last_active_time, client)</strong> pairs,
                    allowing it to efficiently find the least recently active client.</li>
                <li>If the least recently active client exceeds a predefined inactivity threshold (for example, 5
                    minutes), the
                    server sends a <code><strong>ping$</strong></code> message to that client.</li>
                <li>If a <code><strong>ret-ping$</strong></code> response is not received, the server removes the client
                    from the chat.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Note on the Data Structure:</strong>You may use any ordered data structure to implement this
                feature (ordered on timestamp values). However, an ideal data structure would be a
                <strong>min-heap</strong> (the minimum timestamp being at the top of
                the heap). The data structure must be <strong>thread-safe</strong>, as it may be accessed by multiple
                threads (e.g., each incoming client request will update that client’s timestamp, and the ping monitoring
                thread will read the timestamp and remove it if that client does not respond to the
                <code><strong>ping$</strong></code>, etc.).

            <h3><small>5.</small> Further Enhancements</h3>
            <p>These enhancements are not expected to be implemented in this assignment. However, I list them here for
                the interested students who may want to add more programmatically challenging features to develop a
                fuller
                application in the future.</p>


            <p>Here are some possible directions for further development:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reconnection with state preservation:</strong>
                    Allow clients to reconnect with their previous identity and retrieve their state (e.g., muted
                    clients, private message history --- that does not include messages from muted clients, and includes
                    messages previously sent to this client using <code><strong>sayto$</strong></code> etc.). You could
                    use text files or database to implement persistence.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Efficient data structures:</strong>
                    Replace the server’s linked list of clients with a height-balanced tree (e.g., AVL or red-black
                    tree) to improve the performance of search, add, and remove operations. This could result in
                    significant performance improvement if there are hundreds of clients.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Reliable communication layer:</strong>
                    UDP is unreliable, i.e., packets may be corrupted, lost, or delivered out of order. Implement
                    reliability mechanisms over UDP (e.g., acknowledgments, retransmissions) or switch to TCP
                    to ensure message delivery and ordering.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Chat rooms:</strong>
                    Support creation of multiple chat rooms. Clients can join specific rooms, and messages are broadcast
                    within the room rather than globally.
                </li>
