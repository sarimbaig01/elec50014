sfree(mem_ptr)

    STEP 1:
            IF mem_ptr is NULL { 
                return
            }

    STEP 2:
            Compute the address of the block header just before mem_ptr

    STEP 3:
            Identify the zone by address (tiny, small, or medium)

    STEP 4:
            Insert the block into that zoneâ€™s freelist in address order
            
    STEP 5:
            Merge with adjacent free blocks (if any)
            return
